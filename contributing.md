## How to Contribute

We follow a fork and pull request model for contributions which is summarized below

*   Create your own fork of the code
*   Do the changes in your fork
     -  Create pull request

    -   Be sure you have followed the best practice for the project.

    -   Use descriptive Pull Request (PR) name

    -   If your PR is in Work in Progress (WIP) then prefix the title with "WIP-{descriptive feature name}

*   If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. 
*   If there is more number of commits, please combine many commits into fewer, or even one singular commit

*   Ensure release/tag has created when doing major changes or minor changes 

*   Make sure README.md file should be updated as per the moudule operations and versions constraints about the provider, applications (terraform, awscli, go), etc..

*   Make sure to get approval from atleast one reviewer to merge the code in oaccoe
